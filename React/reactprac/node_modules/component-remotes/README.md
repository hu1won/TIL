# Remotes.js [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/componentjs/remotes.js.png)](https://travis-ci.org/componentjs/remotes.js)

The goal of this repo is to normalize different remote endpoints for Component into a unified API.
You can also create your own remote endpoints instead of shoehorning different APIs into a JSON file.
This also handles versions and git trees, which is a little more complicated than just github raw.

Example:

```js
var Remotes = require('component-remotes');
var remotes = Remotes();
remotes.use(new Remotes.Local({
  dir: 'components'
}));
remotes.use(new Remotes.GitHub({
  auth: 'jonathanong:password'
}));

co(function* () {
  // get the correct remote from a list of remotes
  var remote = yield* remotes.resolve('component/emitter');
  // return all the versions this remote has
  var versions = yield* remote.versions('component/emitter');
  // do stuff with the versions
})
```

A shortcut for the above is:

```js
var remotes = require('component-remotes')(['github'], {
  local: true,
  dir: 'components',
  netrc: '',
})
```

Where `netrc` points to a `netrc` file. See [camshaft/netrc](https://github.com/camshaft/netrc).

## Using Remotes

### var remotes = new Remotes([names], [options])

Returns a group of remotes. `names` is a list of redefined remotes. Note that order matters.

The current remotes are:

- `remotes.github`
- `remotes.bitbucket`
- `remotes.local` - use downloaded components

The list of names can be found at `Remotes.remotes`.

Some options are:

- `netrc` - for [camshaft/netrc](https://github.com/camshaft/netrc)
- `dir` - local `components` path. Defaults to `process.cwd() + '/components'
- `local` - use the `local` component.

### remotes.use(remote)

Add a remote to this list of remotes. Note that order matters.

### var remote = yield* remotes.resolve([names], repo, [ref])

Returns the first remote with `<repo>@<ref>` from the list of remotes. You may optionally pass `names`, a list of remote names, instead of searching all the remotes or to search in a different order.

### Authentication

Some remotes, such as GitHub, require authentication. If you want to use authentication in your own remote implementation, we suggest you use [camshaft/netrc](https://github.com/camshaft/netrc).

You can see here how to [setup authentication](https://github.com/componentjs/guide/blob/master/changelogs/1.0.0.md#required-authentication).

## Using a Remote

### remote.name

The name of the remote.

### var json = yield* remote.json(repo, [ref])

Return the `component.json` of a component from this remote.

### var versions = yield* remote.versions(repo)

Get all valid semver version of this remote.

### var tree = yield* remote.tree(repo, ref)

Return the git tree of this repo. Will return a list of objects with properties:

- `path` - file path in the repo
- `sha` - sha1 check sum
- `fize` - file byte length

### var urls = remote.file(repo, ref, path)

Return an array of absolute URLs of where to download this component's file `path`.

### var archive = remote.archive(repo, ref)

Return an object containing absolute URLs of where to download this repo's archive. `archive` is of the format `archive[format] = urls[]`. Example:

```js
{
  tar: [
    'https://api.github.com/repos/component/emitter/tarball/master',
  ],
  zip: [
    'https://api.github.com/repos/component/emitter/zipball/master',
  ]
}
```

## Remote Notes

- Only `master` is supported as the default branch.

### BitBucket

- Git trees are not supported, so please don't use globs in your `component.json`s!

## Creating your own Remote

You may create your own remote. See the [remotes](https://github.com/component/remotes.js/tree/master/lib/remotes/github.js) for implementation examples.

### Remotes.Remote.extend(Child)

Extend a new `Remote` class with the current Remote. Example:

```js
var Remote = require('component-remotes').Remote;

function GitHub(options) {
  options = options || {}
  Remote.call(this, options)

  this.something = 'asdf'
}

Remote.extend(GitHub)

Github.prototype.something = function () {

}
```

### Implementable Functions

The following properties must be implemented. Note that if you want a remote to be skipped, simply return `null`.

- `.name`
- `._json()`
- `._versions()`
- `._tree()`
- `.file()`
- `.archive()`

If a function is not supported, simply do not define it.
For example, BitBucket does not support git trees, so `._tree()` is not defined.
