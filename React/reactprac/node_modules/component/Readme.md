  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/componentjs/component.png)](https://travis-ci.org/componentjs/component)

  Component is a vertically integrated frontend solution, handling everything from package management to the build process, handling everything including HTML, JS, CSS, images, and fonts. Think of it as an opinionated `npm + browserify + rework-npm + grunt/gulp/broccoli` all wrapped into `component build`.

  If you're confused about _component_, _components_, _componentjs_, please read [disambiguation](https://github.com/componentjs/component/blob/master/disambiguation.md)

> **Component 1.0.0**: Several
major new features have been added, some have been removed, and the project has been greatly reorganized. You may need to upgrade your
version of node and/or npm to avoid breakage. Please see the detailed [changelog](https://github.com/componentjs/guide/blob/master/changelogs/1.0.0.md). Component 0.x will not be maintained anymore.

## Installation

  First, you need [node](http://nodejs.org) v0.10+ installed. If you do not have it installed, visit [node's download page](http://nodejs.org/download/).

  With [node](http://nodejs.org) installed, run the following command:

     $ npm install -g component

## Getting Started

Read this [Getting Started](https://github.com/componentjs/guide/blob/master/component/getting-started.md) guide to get a basic static site running very quickly with Component.

Note: the Component repo (this repo) has only documentation for Component 0.19. All of the documentation related to 1.0.0 will be handled in the [guide repo](https://github.com/componentjs/guide).

## Team

The team and organization have undergone massive changes. In summary, [jonathanong](https://github.com/jonathanong) stopped developing Component and started with [normalize.io](https://normalize.github.io/) and the guys from [segmentio](https://github.com/segmentio) switched to using [duo](http://duojs.org). Component will still be maintained and updated while it is in use. You can read more about Duo.js and Component [here](https://github.com/componentjs/component/blob/master/Extra.md#about-duojs).

The long story of Component and the changes that occurred in component can be found in Jonathan Ong's blog post ["the future of component"](http://www.jongleberry.com/the-future-of-component.html).

Development for component (maintenance and features) will be continued at the latest when latest browsers will support the [ES6 modules](http://guybedford.com/es6-modules-today) and [Web Components](http://www.w3.org/TR/components-intro/) natively.
