# Component Flatten

`.flatten()` command in [component-resolver](https://github.com/component/resolver.js). Stored in a separate repo for standalone usag.

The purpose of this method is to:

- Flatten the dependency tree into the proper build order. The proper build order is (specifically for CSS):
  1. Remotes dependencies
  2. Local dependencies
  3. Component's files
- Check for multiple versions of a remote dependency

## API

```js
var resolver = require('component-resolver');
var flatten = require('flatten');

resolver().getTree(function (err, tree) {
  if (err) throw err;
  var branches = flatten(tree);
  // do stuff with the branches
})
```

### var nodes[] = flatten(tree)

`tree` is the result of `resolver`'s `.tree()` or `.getTree()` methods. Nodes will also be populated with:

- `.duplicates` - an object containing remote dependencies with multiple versions
